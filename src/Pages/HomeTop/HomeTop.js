            Pathstreams is a company committed to creating more meaningful
            moments of human connection through technology.

          <p>
            As a growing provider of telecommunication services and equipment
            in Canada, we're proud of our continued investments in our people,
            our communities, and our network.

          <p>
            At Pathstreams, we understand that your business doesnâ€™t have the
            time for a lengthy phone installation with complicated wiring. That
            is why we have made it really easy to install the base station with
            simple do-it-yourself instructions.
